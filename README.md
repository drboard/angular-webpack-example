Webpack + Angular + Bower + Gulp
================================

Minimal boilerplate with webpack (run from gulp) that supports angular (from bower), with some common settings.

It uses https://github.com/segmentio/khaos. 

```
npm install -g khaos
khaos jeffling/angular-webpack-example
```
 

What it has

* webpack configured with the bower path included `bower/<module name>
* angular and karma. It loads angular globally.

Optional stuff: 

* facebook/flo for live reloading in the browser.
* SASS loader
